Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
================================

## Can I build HackMyResume and HackMyCore for my own projects?

Yes. HackMyResume and it's API are both licensed under MIT. Technically all you
have to do is maintain copyright notices. Optionally, you can drop us a note and
we'll add your project to the HackMyResume gallery.
