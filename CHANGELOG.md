CHANGELOG
=========
## 0.2.0

### Changed

- Renamed the project from `HackMyAPI` to `HackMyCore`.

## 0.1.0

Initial release of the HackMyAPI library, corresponding to the 1.6.0
HackMyResume code base.

### Added

- Relocated core processing and analysis code and reusables from the
HackMyResume project to HackMyAPI without modification. CLI-related code lives
in the original HackMyResume. Core processing logic and reusables live here.
