## Code

3. Build something cool or fix something annoying.

4. Verify your changes with `grunt test`.

5. Submit a pull request **targeting the `dev` branch**.

We respond to most pull requests within 24 hours. Rarely, it may take up to a

## Issues

Open new issues at will for bugs, feature requests, questions, or announcements.

## Tools

If you're building a tool that uses HackMyResume, FluentCV, FRESH, FRESCA, or
other related tools, let us know and we'll add you to the exemplar gallery and
optionally add you to the dev list so you can stay ahead of breaking changes.
